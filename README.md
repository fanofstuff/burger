# Unit 13 HW: Burger Generator

This program is, practically speaking, little more than an amusing distraction and a method of allowing us students to practice the creation of ORMs, Heroku servers, RESTful APIs, and full-stack development within a relatively simple framework. 

## Intended Usage

In theory, however, this program is designed to help a very specific kind of user better manage their burger intake by allowing them to input burger names and then cross them off upon eating them. 

## Features

- Persistant database storage of inputted data, powered by JawsDB and MySQL
- A fully deployed server-based application, powered by Heroku
- The ability to input (hopefully burger-based) text, have it display in a list, and then move it to an 'eaten' list by pressing an auto-generated button
